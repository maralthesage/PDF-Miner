## PDF Miner

The goal is to create a database of product information out of unstructured textual data of PDFS.
This is a project for extracting meaningful data from a long list of Catalogue PDFS, structure and output them in CSV format with columns of product ID and product description. The challenge was to find a pattern to
extract product ID and the relevant text for that product and no extra information.
